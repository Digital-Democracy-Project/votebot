# Phase 4: Remove Sync Code from VoteBot — COMPLETE

*Part of: DDP-Sync Migration (see PLAN-move-sync-to-own-service.md for overview)*
*Depends on: Phase 1 running and verified on EC2 (ddp-sync handles all sync jobs)*
*Completed: 2026-03-10*
*Commit: df25db5 — pushed to `main`*

## Goal

Strip all sync/ingestion/scheduler code from VoteBot, leaving it as a pure chat/RAG service. VoteBot's `main.py` drops from ~355 lines to ~131 lines. All sync routes are removed.

---

## Results

**37 files changed, +8 / -14,571 lines** (git reports -14,196 due to rename detection on `federal_legislator_cache.py`)

### Moved
| From | To |
|------|------|
| `src/votebot/sync/federal_legislator_cache.py` | `src/votebot/utils/federal_legislator_cache.py` |

### Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/votebot/main.py` | 356→131 lines. Removed scheduler, leader election, watchdog, zombie sync resume. Kept Redis connect for chat |
| `src/votebot/api/routes/__init__.py` | Removed `sync_router`, `sync_unified_router` imports and exports |
| `src/votebot/core/retrieval.py` | Updated import: `votebot.sync.federal_legislator_cache` → `votebot.utils.federal_legislator_cache` |
| `src/votebot/config.py` | Removed `scheduler_enabled` field (3 lines) |
| `pyproject.toml` | Removed 4 sync-only deps: `tiktoken`, `PyPDF2`, `pdfplumber`, `apscheduler` |

### Deleted (~14,500 lines)
| Path | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `src/votebot/sync/` (entire dir) | ~3,557 |
| `src/votebot/updates/` (entire dir) | ~5,042 |
| `src/votebot/ingestion/` (entire dir) | ~4,553 |
| `src/votebot/api/routes/sync_unified.py` | 542 |
| `src/votebot/api/routes/sync.py` | 460 |
| `src/votebot/api/schemas/sync.py` | 51 |
| `config/sync_schedule.yaml` | 123 |

## Discovery: `embeddings.py` must be KEPT

The original plan called for deleting `src/votebot/services/embeddings.py` (181 lines). However, during verification it was found that **`vector_store.py` imports `EmbeddingService` for `embed_query()`** — this is used at chat time to embed user queries before searching Pinecone. The file was restored and is NOT deleted.

This means `embeddings.py` is shared between sync (embedding documents during ingestion) and chat (embedding queries during retrieval). Both VoteBot and ddp-sync need their own copy.

---

## Verification

### Import verification (all passed)
```
✓ No imports from votebot.sync (except utils.federal_legislator_cache)
✓ No imports from votebot.updates
✓ No imports from votebot.ingestion
✓ No imports from votebot.api.routes.sync
✓ No imports from votebot.api.schemas.sync
✓ embeddings.py exists and is imported by vector_store.py
✓ federal_legislator_cache.py exists in utils/ and is imported by retrieval.py
```

### Dependencies kept (used by chat)
- `pinecone` — retrieval queries
- `openai` — LLM generation + query embeddings
- `httpx` — HTTP calls to OpenStates for vote lookups
- `redis` — thread mapping, pub/sub
- `beautifulsoup4` — content resolution
- `tenacity` — retry logic in llm.py, web_search.py

### Dependencies removed (sync-only)
- `tiktoken` — token counting for chunking
- `PyPDF2` — PDF metadata extraction
- `pdfplumber` — PDF text extraction
- `apscheduler` — scheduled job execution

## Remaining verification (on EC2 deploy, Phase 7)

- [ ] VoteBot starts without errors: `uvicorn votebot.main:app --port 8000`
- [ ] `GET /votebot/v1/health` returns healthy
- [ ] `GET /votebot/v1/health/ready` returns all services connected
- [ ] Chat queries work: `POST /votebot/v1/chat` with a bill question
- [ ] WebSocket chat works
- [ ] Content resolution works: `GET /votebot/v1/content/resolve?url=...`
- [ ] No import errors in logs
- [ ] Sync endpoints return 404 (not 500): `POST /votebot/v1/sync/unified` → 404
- [ ] Federal legislator cache still works (used by retrieval.py for vote lookups)
